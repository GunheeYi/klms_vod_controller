        <h3>Week Calculation</h3>
        Calculating current week is done in a "dirty" way. As I was not able to find any methods provided by the site to get current week, I manually put the start and end of some semesters and computed the desired value. The following is the provided semesters. If it has errors or needs to be updated, please contact me.
        <div id="semesters"></div>
        <script src="shared.js"></script>
        <script src="memo.js"></script>

    </div>

</body>
